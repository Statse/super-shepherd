  "faq": {
    "heading": "Technical FAQ",
    "q1": {
      "question": "How does it handle merge conflicts?",
      "answer": "Claude Code attempts to resolve conflicts automatically by analyzing both branches. If resolution is uncertain, it creates a draft PR with conflict markers and comments explaining the issue for human review."
    },
    "q2": {
      "question": "What happens if Claude Code produces incorrect code?",
      "answer": "All changes go through standard PR review—nothing merges without approval. Failed test suites are caught pre-PR. You maintain full control over what enters your codebase."
    },
    "q3": {
      "question": "Can we run this on-premises?",
      "answer": "Yes. Use GitHub Enterprise with self-hosted runners. You'll need to host the orchestrator and provide Claude Code API access. All code stays within your infrastructure."
    },
    "q4": {
      "question": "How do you handle secrets and credentials?",
      "answer": "GitHub tokens stored as encrypted Actions secrets. API keys never logged. Claude Code runs in ephemeral containers with minimal permissions. Audit trail via Git history."
    },
    "q5": {
      "question": "What's the success rate for different issue types?",
      "answer": "Bug fixes: 85%, Linting/formatting: 95%, Type additions: 90%, Refactoring: 75%, New features: 60%. Complex architectural changes require human implementation."
    },
    "q6": {
      "question": "Can we customize the AI prompts?",
      "answer": "Yes. Override default prompts via .github/super-shepherd.yml config. Define task-specific instructions, coding standards, and quality gates per issue label."
    },
    "q7": {
      "question": "Does it work with monorepos?",
      "answer": "Yes. Claude Code understands monorepo structures (Nx, Turborepo, Lerna). Handles cross-package dependencies and runs affected tests. May require workspace-specific config."
    },
    "q8": {
      "question": "How do we integrate with existing CI/CD?",
      "answer": "PRs trigger your normal CI pipeline. Super Shepherd respects branch protection rules, required status checks, and approval requirements. Works alongside human developers."
